:page-description: Extends JUnit Jupiter with `@FreePort` to get a free port.

== Introduction

Sometimes we want a free port in our tests so that we can either start a server on it or
to test a failure scenario when there is no service at given port.

It's a JUnit Jupiter extension which provides a free port for above-mentioned use cases. Also, there is no guarantee that the port will still be available by the time you use it.

NOTE: You can retry the test in such cases based on `FreePort.isFreeNow`

== Usage

To get the `FreePort` as an argument on a test just add the annotation to your test suite as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----

@ExtendWith(FreePortExtension.class)
class ServerTest {

    @Test
    void test(FreePort port) {
        // use port.number() or check before using port.isFreeNow()
    }
}
